# Artwork-and-Graphics

I've been wanting to improve my graphics skills as a tool to help better communicate my work. If you would like to use any of these graphics, please feel free; however, I do you communicate with me first so I can track how often their being used. 

Please feel free to contact me by email at: dmstev@ucdavis.edu

In the header of the email, please state: "Github Graphics Usage".

And in the email, please state the usage for the graphic (and which one of course).

Thanks and enjoy!!
